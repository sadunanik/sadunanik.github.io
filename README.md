# Looking for your first job as a Software Developer

Tis is the README version

If you are starting your career in software development, the choices you make will determine your options in the future. I wanted to share my experiences for people looking to land their first job after graduation.

It is always challenging to graduate from a University and start working for a salary. I do a lot of interviews, and one of the questions I like to as is what the candidate is expecting from his/her job. Number one answer I get is "I want work with new technologies, learn and use latest programming languages".  The second most popular answer I get is "I want to design and build _new_ software".

For the first answer, I understand the desire of someone to work with something that is new. On the other hand the software industry usually works with established and popular languages. The assessment of a language starts with looking at the ecosystem required to make it work. Is there good support for it in popular IDE's? How easy it is to debug? Once I write an application, can I run it everywhere? Does anyone provide a platform for it on the cloud? Who is behind it and what is the level of the commitment to the technology? What I learned is that even the flashiest looking and sounding technologies from top global vendors can be abondoned in time. Companies also look into the available workforce around a language, and look at how easy it is to learn and master. 

Companies have a portfolio of technologies they use, and and these don't change rapidly. Your experience with a particular technology is less important than your experience as an Engineer.  If you desire to work with the latest tech that is in the news, I recommend you target Research positions. The best way to do this is do Graduate studies after an Undergraduate degree. You will get depth in a particular field which will make it easier to get a Research position. You can also exploit the network of your Advisor in your job search. I would like to add that the StartUp market also experiments with new technology. This market is small compared to the whole Software job market, and it is very competetive, and you may need to work for less money in exchange for future fortune, but it is a good option.

You may want to build something new, and not get some work on something that exists. Unfortunately you may not find such a job easily. Someone without real world experience would not be given the job of building something from scratch easily, and this is a general rule for pretty much every fresh graduate from any field. Your employer takes on the responsibility to make you happy in the work you do, so you need to trust them. They are investing in you. For a company hiring someone new is expensive, losing an employee because he/she is not satisfied is much more expensive.
